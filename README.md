# 🧠 AI-Driven Preventive Decision Support System

### *For Perinatal Mental Health & Risk Stratification*

> **Research Focus:** Shifting maternal mental health care from *Reactive Postpartum Detection* to **Proactive Antenatal Prevention**.

---

## 📄 Abstract

Maternal mental health disorders, specifically perinatal depression, remain a critical public health challenge due to reactive screening methods that often delay diagnosis until the postpartum period.

This project presents a **Preventive Decision Support System (DSS)** that leverages machine learning to predict depression risk during the **antenatal (pregnancy) stage**. Unlike traditional models that rely solely on static demographics, this system integrates:

* 🕒 **Temporal Gestational Markers**
* 💤 **Behavioral Proxies** (Sleep, Appetite, Fatigue)
* 🔍 **Explainable AI (SHAP)** for clinical transparency
* 🛡️ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for evidence-based intervention

## 🚩 Problem Statement

Existing AI solutions for maternal mental health suffer from **four critical limitations** identified in recent literature:

| Problem Area | The Current Limitation |
| --- | --- |
| **Reactive Focus** | Primarily targets Postpartum Depression (PPD) *after* childbirth. |
| **Black-Box Nature** | Lacks interpretability, reducing clinician trust in predictions. |
| **Unimodal Data** | Relies on static sociodemographics, ignoring dynamic behaviors. |
| **Non-Actionable** | Provides risk scores without offering safe, targeted interventions. |

## 💡 Proposed Solution & Novelty

This system introduces a **Stage-Aware, Multimodal Framework** designed to bridge the gap between screening and treatment.

### Key Novel Features

#### 1. 🔮 Dynamic Antenatal Risk Profiler

Utilizes `Gestational Age` as a temporal proxy to calculate risk trajectories throughout pregnancy, serving as an **Early Warning System** rather than a diagnosis tool.

#### 2. 🧩 Behavioral Digital Phenotyping

Extracts functional health signals from clinical questionnaires to refine risk estimation:

* *Sleep Architecture (Insomnia/Hypersomnia)*
* *Anhedonia Indicators*
* *Nutritional Dysregulation*

#### 3. 🧠 XAI (Explainable AI) Inspector

Deploys **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to decompose risk scores.

> *"The system visualizes exactly why a patient is High Risk (e.g., '80% driven by sleep loss, 20% by financial stress')."*

#### 4. 🛡️ RAG-Based Intervention Assistant

A **"Knowledge-Grounded"** engine that retrieves WHO/ACOG guidelines to generate safe, context-aware recommendations based on identified risk drivers.

#### 5. ⚖️ Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Validation

An active learning interface allowing clinicians to validate or correct AI predictions, mitigating **algorithmic drift** and **alert fatigue**.

## 📈 Performance Metrics (Preliminary)

* **Algorithm:** Random Forest Classifier (`n_estimators=100`)
* **Accuracy:** **~88%** (on validation set)
* **Precision (High Risk Class):** 0.87
* **Recall (High Risk Class):** 0.88

> **Key Insight:** Feature importance analysis confirms that *Behavioral Proxies* (Sleep, Fatigue) and *Gestational Age* significantly outweigh static demographic factors in predicting risk.
